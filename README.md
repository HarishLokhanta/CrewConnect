3. Important:  
   - By default, nothing will show.  
   - To make the project work, you must click **"New Project"** in the interface.  
   - This creates a workspace where you can start chatting with the AI.  
   - Inside this chat, you can describe your job (e.g., "I need a licensed electrician tomorrow"), and the AI will turn your answers into structured job data.
